# LAN Packet Sniffer and Analyzer (Wireshark Lite)

A simplified LAN packet sniffer and analyzer built using Python and Scapy. This tool captures network packets, extracts protocol-level details (TCP, UDP, DNS), and logs them into a CSV file for further inspection â€” similar in concept to Wireshark.
